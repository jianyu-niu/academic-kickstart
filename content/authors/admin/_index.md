I am currently a second-year Ph.D. student at School of Engineering, University of British Columbia, supervised by [Prof. Chen Feng](https://people.ok.ubc.ca/cfeng01/index.html), who is the co-cluster lead of [Blockchain@UBC](https://blockchain.ubc.ca).
My research interests lie in distributed system, cybersecurity, as well as blockchain technologies.
Recently, I have been focusing on off-chain scaling technologies, including payment channel networks and sidechains.
