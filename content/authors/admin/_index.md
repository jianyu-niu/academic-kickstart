I am currently a third-year Ph.D. student at School of Engineering, University of British Columbia (Okanagan Campus), supervised by [Prof. Chen Feng](https://people.ok.ubc.ca/cfeng01/index.html), who is the co-cluster lead of [Blockchain@UBC](https://blockchain.ubc.ca).
My research interests lie in distributed system and blockchain technologies.
Recently, I have been focusing on the scalability and incentive analysis of NC-based blockchains and BFT.
